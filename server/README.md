Absolutely! Let's break down the different folders in your application architecture in a simple way, as if you're explaining it to a 10-year-old:

1. **Main Folder (Your Project's Home):** This is like the base of your project. It's where everything starts. Imagine it as the entrance to a big playground.

2. **cmd Folder (Where the Main Game Plan is):** Think of this as the place where the game plan is written. It tells your project what to do first. Like, "Start the game, set up everything, and let the fun begin!"

3. **config Folder (How the Game Will Be Played):** Here, you decide how the game should be played. What rules to follow, like which colors are good, how fast the players can run, and other settings.

4. **database Folder (Getting Ready for the Game):** Imagine this is where you prepare the playground. You set up the swings, slides, and everything needed for the game to happen.

5. **repo Folder (Helpers for Playing the Game):** This is like your helper friends who know all the rules of the game. They help you keep track of scores, who's playing, and stuff like that.

6. **rest Folder (Where People Play the Game):** Think of this like the game field. People come here to play the game. They run, jump, and have fun. The rest folder manages how people can play together.

7. **svc Folder (Managing the Game):** This is like the person who makes sure everything is going well in the game. They decide if someone wins, if the game is fair, and if everyone is happy.

8. **models Folder (Characters and Stuff in the Game):** Imagine this is where you create all the characters for your game. Like the heroes, villains, and other cool stuff you can use to play.

Remember, just like how you can imagine different parts of a playground, your code is like the playground for your computer to play with. Each part has a special job to make the game fun and exciting!
